# README

This is a basic rails app with a single route leading to the /me endpoint.

Things to be done:

* Set up a database of your choosing to be used for storing user data (username/encrypted passwords)

* The /me endpoint should be authenticated using whatever method of user authentication you are comfortable with

* When a user makes an authenticated request to the /me endpoint, return a json payload greeting the user with their name (replace the current placeholder)

* When a request is made with failing authentication, an appropriate error is returned
